<p class="translated">新闻应用今日头条背后的新媒体公司字节跳动和Musical.ly的所有者<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/chinas-toutiao-is-buying-musical-ly-in-a-deal-worth-800m-1b/" rel="noopener">获得了10亿美元的交易</a>，在2018年表现出色。它的估值跃升至200多亿美元，选择了一些国际服务——包括8600万美元的Musical.ly和<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cheetah-mobile-and-bytedance-jointly-announce-strategic-cooperation-on-personalized-content-delivery-services-300551891.html" rel="noopener">新闻共和国</a>——并开始执行一项雄心勃勃的计划，向中国以外扩张，仅今日头条就声称在中国拥有1.2亿用户。</p>
<p class="translated">据《SCMP》报道，在其旗舰服务今日头条在新年前夕被关闭24小时后，这种国际扩张现在可能更为紧迫。</p>
<p class="translated">今日头条是一个从中国媒体收集新闻的一站式应用程序。根据北京互联网信息办公室的说法，它和香港凤凰卫视被关闭一天，因为他们“对网上舆论产生了不良影响”。据说这两人推广了“色情和低俗内容”</p>
<p class="translated">字节跳动没有回复记者的多次置评请求。</p>
<p class="translated">该应用程序已恢复正常服务，但这一事件表明，它现在已经牢牢地在中国互联网审查机构的雷达上。</p>
<p class="translated">去年，中国采取了高压手段来监管互联网，中国一些最知名的科技公司有时首当其冲——尤其是在媒体和新闻内容方面。</p>
<p class="translated"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/tencent-baidu-weibo-investigation-china/" rel="noopener">Baidu and Weibo were investigated over hosting porn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/china-clamps-down-on-live-streaming-services/" rel="noopener">authorities cracked down on live-streaming services</a> as they surged in popularity, while a number of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/world/asia/china-celebrity-news-wechat.html" rel="noopener">high-profile media accounts were removed from WeChat</a> because they did not “actively promote socialist core values.”</p>
<p class="translated">This 24-hour ban serves as a warning that Toutiao, too, must adhere to Beijing’s focus.</p>
<p class="translated">“Generally, China’s leaders have been obsessed with the containment of negative coverage, and under Xi Jinping we’ve seen a rather dramatic decline in serious coverage by China’s media,” David Bandurski, co-direct of the University of Hong Kong’s <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/http://chinamediaproject.org/" rel="noopener">China Media Project</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/world/asia/china-celebrity-news-wechat.html" rel="noopener">told the New York Times</a> in September.</p>
<p class="translated">“What we’re now seeing is a war on the non-serious. It’s no longer enough for media content to avoid the negative. It must be adequately positive,” Bandurski added.</p>
<p class="translated">That would make now a good time to expand overseas. That’s something that ByteDance has been working on for some time, perhaps in the knowledge that sooner or later it would catch Beijing’s eye.</p>
<p class="translated">The firm has made moves in the U.S., via the Musical.ly deal and from <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221206173235/https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/chinese-news-reading-app-toutiao-acquires-flipagram/" rel="noopener">buying Flipagram in February 2017</a>, and it is working to make Toutiao global by using the same AI technology in its English-language news reader apps and News Republic, which it recently acquired from Cheetah Mobile. With Musical.ly, however, it will be focused on growing its presence in China and the rest of Asia, where it is far weaker than the U.S. market, where the service claims some 60 million users.</p>
<p class="translated">Getting trapped in China’s censorship web is a rite of passage for any consumer startup, but it also represents the first serious check on the growth of ByteDance. After a break-out 2017, this year is shaping up to offer a different kind of challenge.</p>
