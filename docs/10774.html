<p class="translated">如你所知，苹果的 AirPods 在每个耳塞中都只有微小的 W1 芯片。这些芯片只支持蓝牙——没有 Wi-Fi，没有 GPS，当然，也没有手机连接。那么，如果你丢失了一个可怜的小气垫，会发生什么呢？</p>
<p class="translated">最有可能的情况是，你的 AirPod 坐在一堆杂志下面的桌子上，你找不到它。如果它在 iPhone 的通信范围内，您可以打开“查找我的 iPhone”应用程序并播放提醒声音。虽然声音不应该像你的 iPhone 的闹铃声音那么大，但它应该足以找到你的 AirPod。</p>
<p class="translated">如果您将 AirPods 留在家里，并且在家里的 iOS 设备的覆盖范围内，您可以在地图上看到它们。如果你真的很不幸，你把你的 AirPods 留在了咖啡店，那么“查找我的 iPhone”会尝试显示你最后一次带着 AirPods 的位置和时间。</p>
<p class="translated">这不是一个完美的解决方案，但如果你倾向于在家里乱放东西，这应该足够好了。</p>
<p class="translated">在其他新闻方面，iOS 10.3 将在 Siri 中添加印度超级联赛的板球比分，CarPlay 的改进和一些小的改进。我最喜欢的更新是地图应用角落的天气应用图标上的一个新的 3D 触摸快捷方式。不用启动专门的天气应用程序，你就可以获得每小时的天气预报。</p>
<p class="translated">iOS 10.3 要测试一两个月。测试期结束后，您可以下载包含这些改进的最终版本。</p>
