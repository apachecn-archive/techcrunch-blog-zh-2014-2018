<p data-amp-original-style="margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;" class="amp-wp-c5a1967 translated">￼<br/>palate smart grill的精确温度烹饪方法不涉及真空密封食物和将其浸泡在水中。取而代之的是，食物被放置在一个完全封闭的台面电烤架上，烤架上有烹饪板，烹饪板中嵌入了传感器，可以测量温度并将温度控制在0.2摄氏度以内。家庭厨师使用iPad来指示食物所需的熟度，这是在精确控制的低温下实现的，当家庭厨师准备好提供食物时，她可以通过在高达600华氏度的温度下烧烤和烧烤食物来轻松地对食物进行最后的润色，所有这些都是使用同一设备。Palate智能烤架可以在任何温度下精确烹饪，并达到比市场上任何电接触烤架更高的温度，因此客户可以完全替换现有的烤架。</p>

<p class="translated">几个月前我们看到了这款设备，简而言之，它棒极了。从里面出来的食物是根据程序设定的轮廓完美烹饪的。光是灼热的功能——高温下的焦糖化过程——就非常值得门票的价格。</p>

<p class="translated"><strong>评委Q &amp; A </strong></p>
<p class="translated"><strong>问:</strong>人们对此很狂热吗？<br/>T5答:人们想要美味的食物</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>问:</strong>你的目标是谁，你是怎么确定的？<br/> <strong>答:</strong>我们要识别的初级用户就是这些想要最好肉的美食爱好者。人们重视方便。当他们的美食家朋友告诉他们这个的时候，他们会想要的</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>问:</strong>有哪些步骤？连我都能做这个这么容易吗？A: 只需轻轻一碰……你就能做出这种牛排，没问题</p>
<p class="translated">问:你能给我讲讲设计吗？<br/> <strong>答:</strong>真漂亮。我们希望你的柜台上有值得骄傲的东西</p>
<p class="translated">问:制造流程是怎样的？<br/> <strong>答:</strong>对于硬件开发来说，把一些关键部分分解出来并不稀奇，所以我们已经这么做了。是我们的电子板在驱动它，我们的传感器。它有一些我们设计的机制…我们将会众筹制造(在稍后的时间)。</p>
<p class="translated">问:这里的技术防御能力如何？答:这项技术有几项专利……但这不仅仅是在这里或那里做一点小小的调整。为了让它正确，我们必须让一切都正确——热设计、控制算法——这样它就永远不会超调，这对这些人来说是一个巨大的转变。你必须考虑食物内部发生了什么，你甚至不能把温度计放进去</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>问:</strong>大部分处理都发生在设备上吗？<br/> <strong>答:</strong>它的控制部分发生在设备上……食谱在后端。</p>
<p class="translated">问:你觉得这和一个从来没做过饭的人和一个在自己家里做大厨的人有什么关系？<br/> <strong>答:</strong>我们的dev大厨就是一个很好的例子……他真的被……水分流失的不足给震住了。这食物确实多汁。那些人会被吹走的</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>问:</strong>我可以用这个做鱼吗？<br/> <strong>答:</strong>鱼很神奇</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>问:</strong>你有海拔的意识吗？<br/> <strong>答:</strong>这里应该不是主要影响。我们正在探测热质量和热量。我们控制所有的热量</p>
