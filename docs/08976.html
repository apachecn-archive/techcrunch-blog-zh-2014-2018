<p class="translated">在介绍视频中，苹果坚持防水功能。运动版有银色、太空灰、玫瑰金和金色可选。它看起来就像最初的Apple Watch——尽管应该有一些新的乐队。现在有三种选择——铝、不锈钢和白色陶瓷。它比不锈钢硬四倍。爱马仕带着新的合作关系回来了。系列2将采用新的爱马仕表带和颜色。苹果还推出了一款耐克Apple Watch，带有特殊的表带、定制的表盘和燃油追踪器。有一些激励特征可以让你跑步。</p>
<p class="translated">至于真的很贵的Apple Watch Edition，好像是苹果在扼杀产品。该公司可能想要一款旗舰机型来表明它对时尚的重视。但现在老佛爷百货、科莱特和爱马仕销售Apple Watch，苹果可以专注于大众市场的手表。</p>

<p class="translated">Apple Watch(铝制型号)和Apple Watch Nike+型号的价格为369美元。它将于9月16日上市。Apple Watch Nike+将于10月下旬上市。Apple Watch“系列1”将继续存在，价格为269美元。它将配备一个新的双核处理器。不锈钢型号的价格没有消息。</p>
<p class="translated">“我们称之为Apple Watch Series 2，它已经完全重新设计了，”杰夫·威廉姆斯说。Apple Watch Series 2具有防水功能。你最多可以游50米。手表系列2是全密封的，除了扬声器。锻炼结束时，扬声器会自动喷水。现在有两个新的健身功能。例如，你可以开始游泳锻炼。</p>
<p class="translated">S2片上系统的双核处理器速度提高了50%，GPU速度提高了一倍。显示屏的亮度增加了一倍，如果你生活在一个阳光充足的国家，这可能会很有用。这是有史以来最亮的显示器。手表系列2有一个内置的全球定位系统，当你不带手机去跑步时，这个功能会很有用。在训练结束时，你会得到一张你的配速图。</p>
<p class="translated">举例来说，内置的GPS对于像<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230226014021/http://www.viewranger.com/"> ViewRanger </a>这样的应用程序来说是很有用的。当公司在舞台上演示时，你可以去远足，如果你走错了路，你会得到提醒和有趣的事实。</p>

<p class="translated">Apple Watch于两年前推出，18个月前上市。是时候刷新一下了。虽然这看起来不像是一个大的更新，但应该足以促进假日季节的销售。</p>
<p class="translated">“苹果手表真的改变了人们对手表的期望，”苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克在台上说。库克还将Apple Watch与其他手表品牌进行了比较。苹果现在是世界第二大手表品牌，仅次于劳力士，领先于化石和欧米茄。“但我们才刚刚开始，”库克说。</p>
<p class="translated">杰夫·威廉姆斯还概述了《watchOS 3》中的一些新功能。回到WWDC，该公司真的吹捧应用程序现在的运行速度有多快，这是对第一版和第二版操作系统的迟钝的一个急需的改进。</p>
<p class="translated">那么苹果到底会如何实现这一点呢？允许第三方和内置应用程序保留在内存中，并在后台更新和刷新信息，即使用户没有使用特定的应用程序。随着Pokémon Go即将登陆Apple Watch，它将变得特别有用。你将能够在神奇宝贝站上滑动，在手表复杂功能中查看附近的神奇宝贝。它将在年底前发货。</p>
<p class="translated">watchOS的第三个版本也有大量与健康相关的改进。例如，苹果正在推出第二款名为Breathe的原生健康应用。该应用程序旨在通过控制呼吸频率来帮助你放松和集中注意力。用户打开他们的应用程序，选择他们想要练习的时间，并通过视觉或触觉提示跟随。watchOS 3将于9月13日发布，适用于所有苹果手表。</p>
