<p class="translated">“Bodygram 为您提供全身测量，其精确度相当于专业裁缝仅通过您手机上的两张照片进行测量。只需拍摄正面照片和侧面照片并上传到我们的云，当您的 Bodygram 尺寸报告准备就绪时，您将在几分钟内收到推送通知。“在尺寸报告中，你会发现你全身的尺寸，包括脖子、袖子、肩膀、胸部、腰部、臀部等。与专业裁缝相比，Bodygram 能够在 99%的精确度内产生尺寸结果。”</p>

<p class="translated">这项技术巧妙地解决了定制服装的最大问题:合身。虽然找到一个根据你的尺寸量身定做衣服的服务很好，但这些尺寸经常会稍微有点偏差，会影响衬衫或裤子的剪裁。Koh 说，现在，如果定制的衬衫不合身，他的团队会提供免费退货。</p>
<p class="translated">此外，这项技术是全新的，避免了原始人体扫描技术的许多缺陷。例如，Bodygram 不像大多数系统那样要求你穿上氨纶连体衣，它只需要两张全身照片就可以捕捉 40 次测量。</p>
<p class="translated">Koh 说:“Bodygram 是第一款在手机上使用的尺寸测量技术，只需两张照片，你在任何背景下穿着普通衣服，它就能为你提供高度准确的尺寸测量结果。”“如今市场上的传统技术要求你穿着非常紧身的氨纶套装，为你拍摄 360 度照片，并且要求工作时背景朴素。其他技术可以给你五英寸的精确度，而 Bodygram 是第一个给你一英寸以下精确度的技术。我们是第一个同时使用计算机视觉和机器学习技术来解决预测衣服下面你的体型的问题。一旦我们预测了你的体型，我们就编写了自己的专有算法来计算身体各部分的周长和长度。”</p>
<p class="translated">Koh 希望这项技术能降低回报。</p>
<p class="translated">“服装退货率达到 40-50%并不少见，”他说。"服装销售是网上购物中渗透率最低的产品之一."</p>
<p class="translated">该系统还可以用来测量你的身体，以便收集健康和体重数据，并帮助其他制造商生产完全适合你的产品。该应用将于今年夏天在 Android 和 iOS 上推出。该公司将把这项技术授权给其他供应商，这些供应商将能够根据几张侧面和正面照片来定制合身的衣服。该公司的销售额今年增长了 175%，现在已经有 35 万名买家在制作定制衬衫。</p>
<p class="translated">许多竞争对手都在这个有趣的领域，最著名的是出现在 TechCrunch Disrupt 上的公司 shape scale T1，它承诺使用机器人秤进行全身扫描。然而，这是第一次商业使用标准照片来测量你的肢体和胸部，这是定制服装领域令人印象深刻的一步。</p>
