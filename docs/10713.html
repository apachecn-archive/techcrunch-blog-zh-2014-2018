<p class="translated">亲爱的妈妈:</p>
<p class="translated">我在拉斯维加斯的CES 2017上度过了一段美好的时光——每隔一段时间，我都会溜出去逛一逛，看看有什么好吃的。在这里走一走，在外面检查一下。有时候我会在桌子底下睡着…这是动物的天性。有时人们想让我检查他们的产品，但我不能马上这么做(无论是时机、匆忙、在桌子下睡着——这可能是很多事情)。有些人真的想让我看看他们的“东西”，并告诉我有时间的时候拿着它去试试。所以我就这么做了。观看上面的拆箱视频，或者，如果你想无聊，看看下面六个项目的照片。</p>
<p class="translated">爱你，你最爱的儿子。</p>
<p class="translated">另外，如果你要做巧克力曲奇，请不要烤焦它们</p>
