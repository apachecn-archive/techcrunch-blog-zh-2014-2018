<p class="translated">该公司于9月下旬开始在澳大利亚测试这项功能，并最终决定在Tinder的全球社区中发布。</p>
<p class="translated">Tinder Boost允许用户付费，让他们的个人资料在30分钟内出现在feed的最前面。当Tinder Boost被激活时，该区域内其他相关的潜在匹配者将会在其他人之前看到你的个人资料。</p>
<p class="translated">收入和核心产品负责人Brian Norgard对此表示:</p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">我们一直在寻找改善用户体验的方法。我们在澳大利亚和英国的测试表明，当激活Boost时，用户平均会收到8-10倍多的个人资料视图和3倍多的匹配。</p></blockquote>
<p class="translated"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230228044236/https://techcrunch.com/topic/company/tinder/"> Tinder </a>仍在测试定价，但我们看到单次提升将达到1.99美元至3.99美元。不出所料，套餐价格会根据您在套餐中购买的提升量有所折扣。</p>
<p class="translated">Tinder Boost被视为独立于Tinder Plus通常包含的高级功能，Tinder Plus是每月无广告的高级Tinder会员，包括无限制的刷卡和每周免费的超级喜欢。</p>
<p class="translated">这一更新似乎正在App Store中缓慢推出，但它可能会在未来几天内登陆大多数用户的手机。</p>
