<p class="translated">Rokoko 是一家新成立的公司，帮助独立电影和游戏制造商用一种新型的低成本动作捕捉套装制作高质量的内容。</p>
<p class="translated">你可能熟悉行业标准的 green man MoCap 套装，许多好莱坞工作室使用它来捕捉电影和游戏中物体或人的运动。Rokoko 的新 Smartsuit Pro 制作了同样质量的动画，但售价仅为 2500 美元的一小部分，使独立电影制作人能够获得同样高质量的效果。</p>
<p class="translated">它看起来更像一件忍者服装，并配备了 19 个陀螺仪传感器，嵌入在服装中，用作运动物体的点。这套衣服自带工作室软件，但数据可以导出到许多不同的动画平台，包括 Unity、Blender 和 Maya。</p>
<p class="translated">创始人 Jakob Balslev 是一位有八年电影制作经验的老手，他刚刚开始运送第一批 300 套服装的订单，并表示他已经卖给了一些大牌客户——包括一些正在制作新的《星球大战》电影的人。</p>
<p class="translated">Balslev 和旧金山芭蕾舞团的首席舞者 Fran Chung 一起来到 TechCrunch 工作室，用 Chung 的一些疯狂芭蕾动作向我们展示它是如何工作的。看看上面的视频，看看钟的动作，更好地了解这套衣服能做什么。</p>
