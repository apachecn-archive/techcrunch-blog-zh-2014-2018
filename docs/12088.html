<p class="translated">首次单击群组对话左下方的加号后，即可选择付款图标。这个月早些时候，随着脸书的信使助手 M 的首次亮相，一个新的、可滚动的用户界面出现了，其他不太常用的功能，如游戏、位置共享、乘车请求等等，都隐藏在这个界面中。</p>

<p class="translated">脸书建议，这项新功能对于每个人都凑钱购物(比如团体礼物)或者分摊餐馆账单的团体来说会很有用。在这些领域，今天的人们仍然倾向于转向独立的支付服务，如 PayPal、Venmo 或 Square Cash。</p>
<p class="translated">除了向其他群组成员付款之外，您还可以在聊天中向群组成员请求付款。</p>
<p class="translated">脸书说，要做到这一点，请输入你希望每个人申请的金额，或者在整个团队中平均分配的总额，无论你是否参与计算。您还可以添加一条说明，说明这笔钱的用途(例如“披萨派对”)，然后点击“请求”将其发送到小组对话中。</p>
<p class="translated">群聊里会出现一条消息，显示是谁付费了。这些详细信息也可以通过全屏查看请求详细信息来获得。</p>

<p class="translated">脸书指出，这项服务可以免费使用，不需要密码。</p>
<p class="translated">支付是脸书业务的一个领域，多年来一直没有受到太多关注，尽管这家社交网络有可能为其庞大的用户群收集和存储支付数据——这些信息可以用于脸书的其他领域，比如游戏或电子商务。</p>

<p class="translated">但脸书一直不愿完全承认其在支付领域的雄心，过去在推出 Messenger payments 时曾表示“不是在打造支付业务”相反，它表示，目标只是让 Messenger 本身更有用，从而更有竞争力。如今，这种情况在团体支付中仍在继续——脸书<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230228174647/https://www.recode.net/2017/4/11/15252854/facebook-messenger-payments-advertising-revenue-business-model">没有提成</a>。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，支付是当今通讯应用的一个重要功能。Facebook Messenger 的竞争对手——如<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230228174647/https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/ca/snapcash"> Snapchat </a>和中国的<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230228174647/https://pay.weixin.qq.com/index.php/public/wechatpay">微信</a>——已经支持应用内支付，Kik 本月详细说明了其打算<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230228174647/https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/07/kik-ceo-payment-is-the-killer-feature-bots-are-waiting-for/">也在自己的应用</a>中添加支付功能。</p>
<p class="translated">在 Messenger 中增加团体支付功能的同时，有传言称脸书正准备在其另一款即时通讯应用 WhatsApp 中推出数字支付业务<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230228174647/http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/04/technology/whatsapp-digital-payments-india-upi/">。</a></p>
<p class="translated">团体支付从今天开始在美国上线。该功能最初在 Android 和桌面上可用。</p>
