<p class="translated">脸书 M 公司的产品经理洛朗·兰多夫斯基说，问题是“它不能扩展到数百万人”，他是自然语言处理初创公司 Wit 的联合创始人。脸书获得的人工智能。</p>
<p class="translated">所以现在，“M 的原始版本将继续帮助我们理解和了解更多关于。。。我们需要建设什么，人们想要什么。”本质上，开放式 M 将继续处理对封闭测试人员集的请求，以便脸书可以确定它的人工智能可以可靠地完成什么任务，以及什么文本表明什么意图。然后，它会慢慢地把这些能力带给 M 建议。</p>

<p class="translated">M 不会把同样的体验应用到每个人身上，而是会了解每个用户的习惯，并为他们进行个性化定制。如果你总是忽略 M 条建议，你会看到的更少。或者，如果你从来不使用它的支付功能，而是不断发送贴纸，它只会建议你使用后者。</p>
<p class="translated">如果你真的讨厌 M，你可以使用 Messenger 设置将它完全静音，或者关闭某些类型的推荐。尽管它只是一个人工智能，而不是人类，但有些人可能会被脸书扫描他们的信息内容以提供这些建议的行为吓到。</p>
