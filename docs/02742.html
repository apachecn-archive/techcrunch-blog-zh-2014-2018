<p class="translated">微软今天<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404165329/https://blogs.office.com/2015/01/29/deeper-look-outlook-ios-android/">发布了针对</a><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404165329/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook"> Android </a>和<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404165329/https://itunes.apple.com/app/id951937596"> iOS </a>手机和平板电脑的 Outlook，基于去年12月<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404165329/https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/01/microsoft-buys-email-app-acompli-for-200m-will-still-support-gmail-and-other-competitors/">收购</a> Acompli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404165329/https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/01/microsoft-buys-email-app-acompli-for-200m-will-still-support-gmail-and-other-competitors/">时获得的应用。这些新应用将在接下来的几个小时内在各自的应用商店上线。</a></p>
<p class="translated">从长远来看，这些新的应用程序将取代微软目前所有的(有些混乱的)Outlook品牌应用程序，包括用于安卓系统的Outlook.com应用程序和相当有限的OWA应用程序。这些旧的应用程序暂时仍然可用，但微软告诉我，它计划随着时间的推移融合这些体验。该公司明确建议安卓系统的Outlook.com用户改用新的Outlook应用程序。</p>
<p class="translated">微软Office部门总经理Julia White本周早些时候告诉我，新的应用程序基于微软去年以2亿美元<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404165329/https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/01/microsoft-buys-email-app-acompli-for-200m-will-still-support-gmail-and-other-competitors/">收购T21电子邮件应用</a><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404165329/https://www.acompli.com/"> Acompli </a>时获得的技术。“我们带来了这个团队，它现在是我们展望团队的核心部分，”她告诉我。</p>
<p class="translated">毫不奇怪，Outlook应用程序的外观和感觉也与最初的Acompli应用程序非常相似。微软已经增加了一些类似Office应用程序的小功能，包括一个彩色的带状用户界面，但如果你曾经使用过Acompli的应用程序，新的Outlook应用程序大多会感觉像是该服务的更名。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，令人惊讶的是，微软一意孤行，决定这么快就以Outlook的名义重新推出这些应用。不过，最重要的是，这可能说明了Acompli应用程序已经有多好了。</p>

<p class="translated">在我们的采访中，怀特强调Outlook应用程序不仅仅是为了电子邮件分类。“他们兑现了Outlook的承诺，”她告诉我。" Outlook用户群肯定会对此感到兴奋."怀特还认为，现在大多数移动设备附带的电子邮件客户端都非常简单，但“人们希望在它们上面做的不仅仅是基本的电子邮件分类”。</p>
<p class="translated">就像之前的微软一样，Outlook将支持Office 365、Exchange、Outlook.com、雅虎邮件和Gmail，以及大多数其他电子邮件提供商。Outlook应用程序还允许你通过许多云服务发送附件，包括微软自己的OneDrive，以及Dropbox和其他服务。与大多数现代电子邮件应用程序类似，新的Outlook应用程序现在也支持各种滑动手势，您可以根据需要进行定制。</p>

<p class="translated">微软认为今天的发布是iOS版本的完整发布，而Android版本仍处于官方预览阶段，尚未得到官方支持。原因在于Android广阔的硬件生态系统。一旦微软收集到更多关于应用程序在现实设备上运行的数据，它将推出新版本的应用程序，并宣布其在Android上的全面可用。如果Android平板电脑的Office应用程序有任何迹象的话，那将是从现在起大约两个月的时间。</p>
