<p class="translated">苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克一开始就表示，86%的iOS设备都安装了iOS 10。软件工程的苹果Craig Federighi随后向我们介绍了iOS 11的新功能。费德里吉说:“iOS 11非常注重技术，但也有新功能。”</p>
<p class="translated">在iOS 11中，贴纸和iMessage应用程序现在可以通过快捷抽屉更容易地访问——无需多次点击来发送贴纸。现在，对话会自动与iCloud同步，并保持同步。如果你删除了一条信息，它就会消失。所以，当你度假回来的时候，就和你Mac上堆积如山的过时信息说再见吧。</p>

<p class="translated">说到Apple Pay，你现在可以向其他Apple Pay用户汇款——想想Venmo或Square Cash。当你想寄钱的时候，它就内置在iMessage里了。如果你收到钱，你会得到一张有余额的Apple Pay现金卡。你可以使用Apple Pay来花这笔钱，再次发送这笔钱或将其提取到你的银行账户中。</p>
<p class="translated">Siri是iOS 11中的重大新更新之一。Siri每月在3.75亿台设备上使用。使用iOS 11，语音听起来更自然，变调更好。你现在可以使用Siri请求翻译——从中文、法语、德语、意大利语和英语开始。</p>
<p class="translated">Siri在理解上下文、你的兴趣等方面变得越来越好。苹果称之为“Siri智能”,它会影响整个操作系统。当有人问你“你还有多远？”，iOS会查看您的日历，了解您应该去哪里，并在信息中给出答案。如果你一直在查看冰岛旅游提示，它会将雷克雅未克添加到你的自动更正词典中，在新闻应用程序中建议关于冰岛的新闻故事等等。</p>

<p class="translated">相机应用程序现在也支持HEVC(也称为h.265)。它应该可以让你用更小的文件拍摄更好质量的视频。看起来图像处理层正在更新，你应该可以用同样的旧手机拍出更好的照片。您可以编辑实时照片以选取不同的主静态照片。而且就像Instagram的回旋镖一样，可以让现场照片来回或者循环。苹果去年在照片应用中增加了记忆标签。在iOS 11中，该公司正在添加新的智能相册，包括#TBT相册。</p>
<p class="translated">控制中心正在接收重大更新。它看起来完全是新的，有很多按钮。苹果不希望你在多个标签页之间切换。例如，你可以在同一页面上调整亮度和暂停音乐。如果你想要更多的细节，你可以在一个小部件上进行3D触摸，以获得更多的功能。</p>
<p class="translated">苹果在iOS 10更新了苹果地图中的行驶方向。现在，通过iOS 11，你可以获得美国城市和机场购物中心的详细地图——美国人会喜欢这个的。</p>
<p class="translated">当你开车时，iOS会识别你通过蓝牙连接到音频系统，或者使用iPhone的运动传感器来激活新的“请勿打扰”模式。在这种模式下，你不会收到任何通知，如果有人给你发短信，你可以设置自动回复。</p>
<p class="translated">AirPlay正在接受重大更新。使用AirPlay 2，您可以使用WiFi连接多个扬声器，并使用iOS设备控制多个扬声器。Libratone、Devialet、Bose、B&amp;O等都将支持AirPlay 2。但这还不是全部。AirPlay 2获得一个开发者API。开发者终于可以玩AirPlay了。</p>
<p class="translated">由于新的MusicKit API，开发者也将能够使用Apple Music。例如，Shazam将能够自动添加歌曲到苹果音乐播放列表(最终)。</p>

<p class="translated">菲尔·席勒简单谈了一下应用商店的变化。最重要的一点是，App Store正在获得一个全新的设计。这看起来有点像苹果新闻。“Today”将为你提供个性化的应用推荐，而游戏则有自己独立的标签。还将有一个“应用”标签，以查看来自应用商店团队的建议。</p>
<p class="translated">基于演示，将有大量的文本，图像和一般内容。它看起来更干净，布局更好，水龙头更少。无论如何，这种重新设计早就应该进行了。</p>
<p class="translated">iOS 11也就这么多了。今天开始测试，你可以期待更多的调整在夏天。9月份，每个人都可以免费下载iOS 11。</p>
<p class="translated"><b>更新:</b>原来苹果公司有一堆新东西在商店里。在主题演讲的最后，Federighi回到舞台上，宣布了iPad特有的功能。在iPad上，现在屏幕底部有一个dock，这样你可以更容易地在应用程序之间切换。如果你需要同时使用两个应用程序，你可以拖放一个应用程序，并使用拆分视图在侧面捕捉它。</p>
<p class="translated">谈到分割视图，应用程序选择器是全新的。它具有控制中心快捷方式以及最近打开的应用程序的预览。这比iOS 10中的小图标列好多了。</p>
<p class="translated">有一个新的文件应用程序，可以让你在iPad和云服务上浏览文件。然后你可以在Mail和files应用之间拖放文件。应用程序不再在筒仓中工作，这对苹果来说是一场大革命。</p>
<p class="translated">你现在可以用Apple Pencil在Notes应用程序中绘图，苹果将使用OCR搜索这些文本。相机应用程序也正在接收原生文档扫描。当你截图时，角落会出现一个微小的弹出窗口。如果你点击它，你可以裁剪你的屏幕截图并给它添加注释，而不必打开照片应用程序。</p>
<p class="translated">在很多方面，iPad上的iOS感觉更像是一台传统的电脑。有浮动窗口，一个码头等等。这就是苹果计划如何让iPad变得更强大。</p>
<p class="translated">iOS 11将在iPad Air和更高版本、iPad mini 2和更高版本、iPad 5代和更高版本、iPhone 5s和更高版本上运行。</p>
