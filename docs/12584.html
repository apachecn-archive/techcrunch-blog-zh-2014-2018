<p class="translated">作为一个已经给比当前目标年龄稍小的用户发放零用钱的家长，我从个人经验中知道，最大的挑战之一就是在适当的时候手头上有现金。如今，人们不太需要携带现金，因此，一次自动取款机之旅成了一件特别的事情。</p>

<p class="translated">“我在华尔街做了 17 年的交易员和经理，”他说。“现在，作为一名父亲，我想用财务纪律来帮助(我的女儿)。]"</p>
<p class="translated">Current 可以通过将孩子的零花钱数字化来帮助父母远离现金——但它不仅仅是一个与应用程序连接的借记卡。iOS 和 Android 的移动应用程序可以帮助父母为他们的孩子设定期望和指导方针，不仅包括如何和何时赚钱，还包括如何花钱。</p>
<p class="translated">该应用程序允许父母设置在支付津贴之前必须首先完成和审查的家务，或者父母可以选择每周自动转账一笔他们选择的金额。</p>
<p class="translated">通过将该应用程序与 Visa 借记卡相结合，孩子们获得了自主权，但支出仍可由父母自行监控。例如，父母可以设定一天可以花多少钱，或者从自动取款机里取出多少钱的消费限额。(你也会想这么做的，因为它们被默认设置为典型水平——从 ATM 机取款 500 美元，日常消费 2000 美元。)</p>
<p class="translated">此外，父母可以阻止该卡在特定类别的企业中使用，这些企业不适合儿童或需要父母的知识和许可，如赌场、酒吧、航空公司等。家长甚至可以阻止选定的商家，但只能在最初的交易发生后。</p>

<p class="translated">这种钱包还提供内置的储蓄功能，包括将购买的东西四舍五入到下一美元以节省零钱，或者从“消费钱包”——孩子的主要银行账户——转账。</p>
<p class="translated">另一个名为“捐赠钱包”的功能鼓励家庭合作，通过搜索美国的 200 万个 501(c)慈善机构来找到他们想要支持的慈善机构，然后留出每月的捐款。</p>
<p class="translated">该应用程序本身是精心打造的，相当容易使用，并与任何银行账户或信用合作社。它只需要几分钟的时间来设置，然后让父母只需点击几下就可以管理服务的各个方面。</p>

<p class="translated">对孩子们来说，还有另一个巧妙的功能。Current 与许多移动消息服务合作，包括 Facebook Messenger、Kik、iMessage 和其他服务，因此他们可以查看自己的账户余额，查看交易，并了解自己的消费习惯。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，电流不是免费的。这项服务是按订阅付费的，每月收费 2 到 3 美元，取决于你选择的是一年还是两年的订阅。每月 5 美元还可以选择包月。</p>
<p class="translated">目前，Current 在美国以外还不可用，但 Sopp 说扩展计划正在进行中。</p>
<p class="translated">他表示:“我们已经与加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、德国和英国的银行进行了洽谈，似乎存在需求。”。</p>
<p class="translated">该公司是从 Expa Studio 孵化出来的，该公司帮助创建和扩大初创公司。今年早些时候，Expa 还与 Human Ventures 共同领导了 Current 的 360 万美元融资。</p>
<p class="translated">这款应用可以在苹果应用商店和 Google Play 上免费下载。</p>
