<p class="translated">但是有一个数字(如果你是一个健康迷，这是一个很重要的数字)几乎被市场上所有的健身追踪器忽略了:身体质量指数。</p>
<p class="translated">由一家制造专业级身体合成工具的韩国公司制造的<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230217081001/https://www.inbodyusa.com/pages/band"> InBody Band </a>，是消费市场上首批可以告诉你身体构成的跟踪器之一。</p>
<p class="translated">但是当你带上一个健身追踪器，这就是你想要的吗？</p>
<h2 class="translated">设计</h2>
<p class="translated">虽然苹果和 Fitbit 等其他公司正在努力制造不像<em>和</em>健身设备的产品，但 InBody 似乎并没有将时尚作为优先事项。</p>
<p class="translated">InBodyBand 看起来像所有第一代健身追踪器，与 FitBit Alta 有着惊人的相似之处。它配有一条聚合物带，显示屏又长又瘦，尽管戴在手腕上相当厚。</p>
<p class="translated">这大概是为了给电极(测量身体成分)和电池腾出空间，电池一次充电应该可以持续一周。我发现它持续的时间接近五天，然后是一整周。该带通过 microUSB 充电。</p>
<p class="translated">LCD 显示屏明亮易读，尽管明亮的阳光可能会使事情变得更困难。</p>
<p class="translated">用户只需按下显示屏旁边的按钮，即可浏览他们的每日指标，当然，还可以查看时间。值得注意的是，显示屏不是常亮显示屏，所以你仍然需要按下按钮来查看时间。换句话说，这不是一个伟大的手表替代品。</p>
<p class="translated">InBodyBand 有五种不同的颜色——黑色、灰色、栗色、粉色和橙色——每种颜色在显示屏附近都有银色装饰。</p>
<h2 class="translated">表演</h2>
<p class="translated">正如我提到的，InBodyBand 做了你期望健身追踪器做的一切——测量步数、消耗的卡路里、行进的距离和睡眠——并且做得很好。然而，在 2016 年，这种类型的功能相当无聊。</p>
<p class="translated">但是 InBody Band 也可以使用设备内部的特殊电极来测量身体成分和心率。用户可以通过将腕带贴在皮肤上进行测试，这需要不到一分钟的时间。心率测试所需的时间更短(不到 10 秒)。</p>
<p class="translated">电极通过身体发送小电流并测量电压，返回关于身体组成的信息。该应用程序然后会就如何变得更健康提出建议，无论是减少脂肪还是增加肌肉。</p>
<p class="translated">虽然这种方法不像专业级的机器那样精确，而专业级的机器要花费数千美元，但它并不意味着精确的读数，而是长期观察身体成分的变化。</p>
<p class="translated">为此，InBody 乐队做了它应该做的事情。这些测试快速而无痛，你可以看到身体质量指数随着时间的推移而发生的细微变化。</p>
<p class="translated">也就是说，这些测试似乎不是日常必需品，尤其是考虑到市场上有智能秤可以执行相同的测试。</p>

<h2 class="translated">该应用程序</h2>
<p class="translated">InBody 通过 InBody 应用程序显示这些信息。</p>
<p class="translated">该应用程序还可以让你在记录中指定在各种活动高峰期间你在做什么活动，就像 FitBit 的最新设备一样。然而，FitBit 能够根据运动来确定您的活动，而 InBody Band 需要手动输入这些信息。</p>
<p class="translated">奇怪的是，这款应用并没有记录心率信息。相反，你的读数会在显示屏上显示几秒钟，然后永远消失。如果这是一个你想用详细的记录来跟踪的统计数据，你要做的工作比简单地按一个按钮要多得多。最后，该应用程序提供了文本通知警报，它会在腕带上振动。</p>
<h2 class="translated">结果</h2>
<p class="translated">硬件和软件都达到了标准。虽然我希望屏幕在阳光直射下更亮，但这家伙的电池寿命不仅仅是可以接受的，而且似乎是准确的(当与我其他健身追踪器的信息进行比较时)。我还发现了跟踪我的身体脂肪、肌肉等的能力。是迷人的，尽管通常是不必要的。</p>
<p class="translated">InBody Band 本身没有什么问题，但我不确定我是那种需要身体质量指数跟踪的人，尤其是这个价格。</p>
<p class="translated">对于真正的健身爱好者来说，InBody 乐队可能是一个值得的选择。它提供了对身体的更深入的观察，以及它如何对各种活动、食物等做出反应。然而，对于更休闲的用户来说，很难将 InBody Band 与 FitBit 等其他健身追踪器结合起来。</p>
<p class="translated">该设计植根于健身，而不是风格，身体质量指数周围的额外信息可能不会对临时用户有用。此外，<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230217081001/https://www.inbodyusa.com/pages/band"> InBody Band </a>售价 180 美元，这使得它处于一个尴尬的空间，介于真正的智能手表(内置健身跟踪功能)和便宜得多的健身追踪器之间，后者涵盖了所有基本信息，如步数、卡路里等。</p>
