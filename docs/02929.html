<p class="translated">当地的画框店让人应接不暇，即便如此，价格也高得离谱。另外，你永远不知道它实际上会是什么样子。但是,<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230216193057/https://www.levelframes.com/"> YC支持的Level Frames </a>正在通过技术来解决这个混乱。</p>
<p class="translated">Level是一个在线平台，任何人都可以找到合适的尺寸合适的相框，甚至可以了解艺术品在不同相框中的外观。然后，Level会处理包装和运输事宜，在某些情况下，可以在两个工作日内将相框送到您手中。</p>
<p class="translated">它是这样工作的:</p>
<p class="translated">当你第一次进入第二层时，你只需输入你选择的艺术品的尺寸并开始浏览。你可以查看各种框架、垫子等。甚至上传一张你的作品的照片，感受一下它的样子。Level与当地的框架商合作处理所有库存，并开发了自己的框架设计。</p>
<p class="translated">Level的联合创始人乔希·哈鲍尔说:“我们已经认识到，过多的选择确实会阻碍人们做出决定。也就是说，Level有几个不同的样式可供选择，带有各种抠图选项。</p>
<p class="translated">但是<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230216193057/https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/level-4">级</a>远远超出了简单的框架。其实Level更多的是一个平台。</p>
<p class="translated">该网站还为希望出售装裱作品的艺术家提供了特殊的店面，Level还为不同的电子商务平台提供了“购买装裱”按钮，以添加到他们自己的商店中。只要几行代码，从Etsy经销商到Urban Outfitters的任何人都可以在他们的网站上添加一个按钮，这样用户就可以购买艺术品并直接进入Level的定制取景工具。</p>
<p class="translated">如果这还不够，Level还提供了一个活动平台，艺术家可以在平台上出售<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230216193057/https://www.levelframes.com/limited/Commodore-64-Framed-Print">限量版印刷品或印刷尺寸</a>。</p>
<p class="translated">水平是推出了Y组合加速器，如果你想了解更多，你可以前往<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230216193057/https://www.levelframes.com/">网站就在这里</a>。</p>
