<p class="translated">Boatsetter将从Boatbound plus logistics tech及其船只租赁库存中挑选人才。一位熟悉该交易的消息人士称，收购是用Boatsetter的股票支付的，价值在数百万美元左右。</p>
<p class="translated">这笔交易使Boatsetter成为美国，甚至可能是世界上最大的点对点船舶租赁服务。</p>
<p class="translated">为了资助未来对其他竞争对手的收购，Boatsetter还宣布，它已经在2016年12月的A轮融资中增加了475万美元的资金，使这家初创公司的融资总额达到1775万美元。</p>

<p class="translated">“资金的主要用途是M&amp;A、增长和国际扩张，”Boatsetter首席执行官Jackie Baumgarten告诉我。当被问及她是否会追随欧洲同行Click To Boat时，她说，“我认为我们最好准备采取卷起式战略。有机会获得和积累一些球员。整合的时机已经成熟。”</p>
<h2 class="translated">每个人都是队长</h2>

<p class="translated">自从2016年<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230314175444/https://www.geekwire.com/2016/heres-boatbound-airbnb-boats-relocated-hq-seattle/" rel="noopener">将</a>从旧金山搬到西雅图以削减成本并推动盈利以来，<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230314175444/https://boatbound.co/" rel="noopener">船上的</a>安静了下来。现在这个全国性的服务有点奇怪地被一个只在一个州运营的竞争者收购了。</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="translated">合并后的公司希望事情能够顺利进行，这要归功于Boatbound用于路由租赁请求的技术以及Boatsetter对保险的关注。</p>

<p class="translated">总部位于佛罗里达州的Boatsetter是一个三方市场，私人船主和专业租船公司、船长和承租人在这里会面。用户可以从附近的船上挑选，租一艘配有船长的船或挑选一名单独的船长，并以可承受的价格快速出海。由于私人业主只是试图收回一些保持船只漂浮的不间断费用，Boatsetter可能比通过传统的租赁公司更便宜。</p>
<p class="translated">鲍姆加滕实际上创办了一家名为Cruzin的点对点划船保险公司，后来与Boatsetter合并。这就是Boatsetter如何提供100万美元的责任保险，200万美元的船只损坏保险，以及额外的保护伞保险，以使承租人感到安全。</p>
<p class="translated">Boatsetter表示，它有5000艘经过审查的船只可用，并准备在今年5X增长到超过10，000艘出租。这是因为Boatsetter只专注于佛罗里达州，而Boatbound与全国各地的船只合作。在这种商业模式下，Boatsetter从船主那里收取28%的租赁费，从船长那里收取10%的费用，并向租赁者收取7.5%的预订费。考虑到Boatsetter不拥有或维护任何船只，这些组合成一个健康的利润。</p>
<h2 class="translated">体验&gt;占有</h2>
<p class="translated">现在，这家27人的初创公司有了一个新的渠道来追逐每年约500亿美元的潜在游艇租赁市场。Boatsetter与Airbnb的新体验平台合作，让人们付费在旧金山湾学习航行，<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230314175444/https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/72293" rel="noopener">在迈阿密向职业尾波冲浪运动员学习</a>或在船上享用巴塞罗那厨师新鲜烹制的西班牙海鲜饭。</p>

<p class="translated">Boatsetter最大的挑战将是培养意识。大多数人认为他们需要一大笔钱或划船技能才能出海。但是，世界正在从物质文化转向体验文化。这就是Airbnb爆掉的原因。</p>
<p class="translated">人们想做一些令人惊奇的事情，他们可以用拍照手机捕捉，并在社交网络上分享。他们想要回忆。很难和朋友们在自己的私人游艇上冲浪，即使只是一个下午。</p>
