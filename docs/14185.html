<p class="translated">年轻用户使用移动应用参与数字媒体的比例甚至更高。comScore发现，在18至24岁的人群中，三分之二的数字媒体时间都花在了单独使用智能手机应用上。毫不奇怪，随着用户年龄的增长，这一比例稳步下降，例如，只有27%的65岁及以上的老年人将数字媒体时间花在智能手机应用上。</p>
<p class="translated">除了数字媒体时间，更年轻的千禧一代——也就是18岁至24岁的人——总体上大量使用应用程序。例如，他们每天花在应用程序上的时间超过3小时，相比之下，25至34岁的人每天花2.6小时，35至44岁的人每天花2.3小时。</p>

<p class="translated">这不是第一份发现大多数用户不下载新应用的报告。comScore早在2014年就发现了这一趋势；在去年九月<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230210004740/http://fortune.com/2016/09/16/smartphone-users-apps/">发布的一份报告中</a>它再次出现。</p>
<p class="translated">这一点没有随着时间的推移而改变。就日常使用而言，它指向了应用程序的一种饱和点。脸书和谷歌在前10名中占有8个应用，这对大多数人来说已经足够了。</p>
<p class="translated">今天，大多数应用程序用户每月访问20个或更少的应用程序，他们最常用的应用程序占他们使用应用程序时间的一半。他们最常用的10个应用几乎占据了他们在应用上花费的所有时间。这给新来者留下了很小的空间。</p>
<p class="translated">似乎就连Snapchat这样的热门产品也没有在老年用户的手机上找到吸引力。这些应用在18至24岁的人群中排名第三，在25至34岁的人群中排名第六，但在34岁以上的用户中没有进入前八。</p>

<p class="translated">这些数据几乎让人觉得，为除了千禧一代以外的任何人开发新应用都没有太大意义，因为他们是唯一一个对下载更多应用表现出浓厚兴趣、愿意付费并有能力大规模采用新应用的群体。</p>
<p class="translated">该报告还更深入地研究了这一年轻群体的其他习惯，甚至注意到了一些奇怪的琐事，如他们如何删除带有糟糕标志的应用程序，他们如何将应用程序组织到文件夹中，以及他们如何将应用程序放置在设备上以便用拇指轻松访问等。</p>
