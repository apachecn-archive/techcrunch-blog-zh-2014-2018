<p class="translated">鉴于目前围绕广告屏蔽的对话以及谷歌对广告作为其主要收入来源的依赖，对话也触及这个颇具争议的话题就不足为奇了。Ramaswamy承认了这个问题，但也认为广告屏蔽首先是一个用户问题。</p>
<p class="translated">“这是因为用户的广告拖慢了他们的页面，”他说，并补充说这是一个特别糟糕的移动问题。拉马斯瓦米认为，该行业必须更好地监管自己，无论是什么解决方案，都不能只是谷歌的解决方案，因为只有全行业的解决方案才会有必要的可信度。“这必须被视为一个公平的行业标准，而不是谷歌正在推动的东西，”他说。</p>
<p class="translated">至于手机，拉马斯瓦米指出，谷歌的第一批手机广告是在2005年推出的。然而今天，他的团队所做的一切都是移动优先。几年前的数据显示，移动搜索将很快超过桌面搜索，这给该团队敲响了警钟。虽然很容易认为移动是谷歌的一个问题，但Ramaswamy说他认为这是一个机会。“但是当涉及到用户界面设计时，你必须有一个不同的思维模式，”他指出。</p>

<p class="translated">当然，在手机上，网络广告和应用程序中的广告仍有很大差距。就应用程序而言，Ramaswamy认为“应用程序模型仍然非常笨重”，因为下载和安装应用程序需要时间(然后它们经常被遗忘)。不过，他认为随着时间的推移，网络和应用程序的世界将会“融合在一起”。</p>
<p class="translated">Ramaswamy还认为，移动设备也可能催生新的小额支付模式。他认为，互联网过度依赖广告。如果你登录了所有的浏览器——就像你可能在手机上一样——也许你会对为你阅读的每篇文章支付几美分有不同的想法。他认为，互联网的健康取决于为出版商提供更多的非广告盈利选择。基于这一点，可能值得关注谷歌计划如何推动这一场景向前发展。</p>
<p class="translated">当然，广告依赖于拥有大量的用户数据。这里的观点可能各不相同，但Ramaswamy认为谷歌在透明度方面一直领先，他的团队总是把用户放在第一位。虽然谷歌有工具来检查公司对你的了解，但事实是很少有用户真正使用它们。正因为如此，Ramaswamy说“与用户签订简单的合同”是很重要的。</p>
