<p class="translated">该报告称，如今应用程序正在推动大部分的媒体消费活动，目前在移动设备上每 8 分钟的媒体消费中，应用程序就占了 7/4。在智能手机上，应用程序的活跃度甚至更高，使用率为 88%，而在平板电脑上为 82%。</p>
<h2 class="translated">应用程序用户</h2>
<p class="translated">该报告还详细介绍了几个有趣的数字，这些数字与美国应用程序用户如何与这些移动应用程序互动有关，并指出超过三分之一的人每月至少下载一个应用程序。智能手机用户平均每月下载 3 个应用程序。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，之前可能没有被很好理解的是，大部分下载活动都集中在一小部分智能手机用户中:前 7%的智能手机用户占<em>某个月所有下载活动的近一半</em>。很明显，这些人都是超级用户。</p>
<p class="translated">但是，无论消费者多频繁地主动下载应用程序，他们肯定会对它们上瘾。超过一半(57%)的人每天都使用应用程序，而 26%的平板电脑用户每天都使用应用程序。79%的智能手机用户几乎每天都使用应用程序，称他们每月至少使用 26 天，而平板电脑用户的这一比例为 52%。</p>

<h2 class="translated">脸书仍然排名第一</h2>
<p class="translated">这里还有一个值得注意的花絮:智能手机上 42%的应用时间发生在个人最常用的应用上。4 分钟中有 3 分钟花在个人排名前 4 的应用上。前十大最常用应用中有 9 个是顶级品牌，包括脸书、谷歌、苹果、雅虎、亚马逊和易贝。</p>
<p class="translated">脸书是使用最多的应用程序，无论是在受众规模还是在每个人群中花费的时间份额方面。</p>
<p class="translated">社交网络、游戏和广播占了应用总使用时间的近一半，表明移动使用主要集中在娱乐和通信上。</p>
<p class="translated">在 iPhone 上，用户更喜欢花时间消费媒体，新闻应用、广播、照片、社交网络和天气是排名最高的类别，而 Android 用户在搜索(谷歌)和电子邮件(Gmail)上花的时间更多。</p>
