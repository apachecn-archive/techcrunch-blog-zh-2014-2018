# 中国接近庞大的新芯片基金，以主导美国半导体产业

中国政府已经把在技术上独立于美国列为最优先考虑的事情之一。现在，它似乎将资金投入到了它所传递的信息上。

[据华尔街日报](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-plans-47-billion-fund-to-boost-its-semiconductor-industry-1525434907)报道，中国即将敲定一个 470 亿美元的投资基金，用于资助半导体研究和芯片创业开发。该基金的前身是中国集成电路产业投资基金有限公司，似乎主要由政府资金来源承销。

[这样一个基金已经传闻了几个月](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/http://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2135263/china-plans-raise-funds-us316b-fuel-chip-industry)，基金的规模变化很大。就在两周前，路透社报道该基金将达到 190 亿美元，而彭博在两个月前报道为 315 亿美元。确切的数字似乎正在中国领导层的紧张谈判中，也是对与美国日益紧张的贸易谈判的回应。

如果 470 亿美元的数字得以实现，[这将与 2015 年中国领先的工程大学清华大学](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tsinghua-m-a-idUSKCN0T50DU20151116)资助的 470 亿美元基金规模相同，该基金旨在刺激本土半导体产业的发展。

中国的半导体产业高度依赖外国技术，为了给快速增长的经济提供动力，中国 90%的芯片都要进口。中国政府一直对这种依赖保持警惕，但在美国禁止美国公司向中国著名的电信设备制造商中兴通讯出售零部件后，中国政府的担忧在最近几周加剧。

Chinese President Xi Jinping has gone on something of [an indigenous innovation tour in recent weeks](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/29/c_137144438.htm), visiting factories across the country and encouraging further investment in the country’s technology industry. [From the Communist Party of China’s official newspaper the People’s Daily two weeks ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/http://en.people.cn/n3/2018/0426/c90000-9453652.html), “National rejuvenation relies on the ‘hard work’ of the Chinese people, and the country’s innovation capacity must be raised through independent efforts, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday.”

While the numbers discussed are eye-popping, so are the costs of developing leading-edge semiconductor technology. As semiconductors have grown more complex, [costs have skyrocketed to maintain Moore’s Law](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://www.technologyreview.com/s/418576/the-high-cost-of-upholding-moores-law/). Intel spent more than $13 billion on R&D expenses alone in 2017, [according to IC Insights](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/http://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Top-10-Semiconductor-RD-Spenders-Increase-Outlays-6-In-2017/), with Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Samsung each spending more than $3 billion.

While China may try to play catchup in the broad category of semiconductors, it is strategically placing its money on new areas like 5G wireless and artificial intelligence-focused chips where it might become a leading provider of technology. Concerns over 5G in particular have [galvanized American attention on Qualcomm](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328114917/https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/10/qualcomm-vs-broadcom/) and its ability to compete in what is rare virgin territory in the telecom equipment space.

For American companies like Intel and Qualcomm, which are used to holding de facto monopolies on entire swaths of the semiconductor market, the renewed competition from China is going to pressure them to push their tech forward faster.
