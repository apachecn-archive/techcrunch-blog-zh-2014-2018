				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Evernote’s Chinese service, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221203224914/https://www.yinxiang.com/">Yinxiang Biji</a>, has temporarily disabled its public note feature, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch today. It’s unclear why public notes was taken down or when it will be restored. We’ve asked the company for more information. Yinxiang Biji (a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221203224914/https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2012/05/09/evernote-launches-separate-chinese-service/">separate service</a> launched by Evernote especially for China) users can continue sharing and collaborating notes using its Work Chat feature or email.</p>
<p class="translated">Unless Yinxiang Biji (which means “memory notebook”) confirms that it disabled the public note feature because of an order from the government, it’s difficult to say for certain if it is related to censorship because the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221203224914/http://www.cac.gov.cn/">Cyberspace Administration of China</a>, the state agency in charge of Internet regulation, usually does not announce when it blocks a site or service.</p>
<p class="translated">The disabling of Yinxiang Biji’s public note feature is interesting, however, because the tool was used to share news articles, editorials, and other information about last fall’s pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, leading to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221203224914/http://qz.com/282710/the-new-anti-censorship-tool-in-china-evernote/">speculation that it may become an important way to circumvent censorship</a>.</p>
<p class="translated">Furthermore, while Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have already been blocked in China for years, the government appears to have stepped up regulation of foreign Internet services over the past year. In June, for example, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221203224914/http://mashable.com/2014/06/03/china-blocks-google-tiananmen-square/">access to several Google services and apps were cut off</a> before the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Last month, Gmail appeared to be blocked in China, before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221203224914/https://beta.techcrunch.com/2014/12/30/access-to-gmail-partially-restored-in-china/">access was partially restored</a>. Instagram was <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221203224914/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29409533">also reportedly blocked</a> in China after the Hong Kong demonstrations.</p>
<p class="translated">中国目前拥有 1150 万用户，是 Evernote 的第二大市场。尽管由于审查制度，外国互联网公司很难进入中国，但 Evernote 成功了，因为它的服务主要用于个人笔记，而不是社交分享。但禁用其公共注释功能表明，随着其受欢迎程度的提高，该公司可能会受到更严格的政府监管。</p>
