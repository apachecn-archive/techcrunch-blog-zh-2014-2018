<p class="translated">这意味着，教师可以通过应用程序直接引导学生学习特定的课程，而不是指导学生下载应用程序，然后指导他们如何访问单个任务。</p>
<p class="translated">这让学校能够利用苹果应用商店生态系统的力量，该生态系统受益于更具策划性和可信度的体验，许多儿童应用出版商首先推出他们的新应用和更新应用，并/或保留更大的目录。</p>
<p class="translated">选择教育应用程序已经与学校工作，包括解释一切，Tynker，GeoGebra和Kahoot！。</p>

<p class="translated">通过这种分配应用内任务的能力，教师可以看到学生在指定任务中的表现，而不仅仅是他们对应用的整体使用情况。他们还可以从自己的仪表板上看到整个教室的表现。</p>
<p class="translated">苹果公司在首次发布时特别强调了学校作业的隐私因素，今天又重申了这一点。</p>

<p class="translated">该公司表示，学校可以“创建、拥有和控制”学生使用的账户，并且可以决定何时共享学生的进度信息。</p>
<p class="translated">苹果也看不到学生的活动，因为它停留在系统中。</p>
<p class="translated">如今，隐私是苹果产品的一个关键卖点。它可能会刺激更多人在课堂上采用其硬件和软件设备，尽管其面向学校的新iPads价格为299美元，比谷歌的一些低端Chromebook价格要高，例如，价格在100美元至150美元之间。</p>
<p class="translated">今年早些时候，在芝加哥的活动中，还展示了新的iPads，以及用于数字图书创作的软件、Mac教室、更新的Swift Playgrounds应用程序和其他教育工具。</p>

<p class="translated">学校作业旨在与教室应用程序配合使用，该应用程序现在可以在iPad和Mac上运行。</p>
<p class="translated">教室应用程序允许教师在课堂上查看学生的屏幕，与学生共享文档，分配共享的iPads，以及重置学生密码。与此同时，学生使用学校作业来查看教师共享的内容，如公告、讲义、文档、pdf和网络链接，并跟踪他们的作业到期情况。</p>
