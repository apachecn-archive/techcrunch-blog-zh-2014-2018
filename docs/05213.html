				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">The Chinese government arrested hackers at the request of the U.S. government just two weeks before <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207024112/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/x/xi_jinping/index.html">Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> visited the United States.</p>
<p class="translated">The arrests, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207024112/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-a-first-chinese-hackers-are-arrested-at-the-behest-of-the-us-government/2015/10/09/0a7b0e46-6778-11e5-8325-a42b5a459b1e_story.html">reported by the Washington Post</a> on Friday, signal slight progress with China on cybersecurity. They came amid high tensions as the Obama administration threatened to impose harsh economic sanctions on China in the wake of several high profile hacks reportedly linked to the country, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207024112/https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/us-government-begins-outreach-to-office-of-personnel-management-hack-victims/">the Office of Personnel Management breach.</a></p>
<p class="translated">Recently China has said it would rein in attacks against the United States, but today’s report reveals China is taking action. The arrests are perhaps more significant than the recent cyber deal the United States struck with China two weeks ago because many worried it was just an empty promise.</p>
<p class="translated">The deal was a landmark agreement because it showed the two countries could talk about cybersecurity — an issue that has caused tension between them for years. Here’s what the White House said in a<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207024112/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states"> fact sheet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">The United States and China agree that neither country’s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.</p></blockquote>
<p class="translated">But it quickly gained criticism from experts in the cybersecurity field. Paul Rosenzweig of Lawfare, sarcastically headlined his response to the agreement <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207024112/https://www.lawfareblog.com/i-feel-much-safer-already">“I Feel Much Safer Already.”</a> It was vague and offered little explanation for how both sides would be held accountable.</p>
<p class="translated">But <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207024112/http://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/herbert_lin">Herb Lin</a>, a Stanford cybersecurity scholar, said it was promising that the summit did not break down. He said both sides needed to take action.</p>
<p class="translated">“Now each side needs to walk through the doors,” Lin said when the deal was released. “This could just be yet another the thing that sits around that doesn’t go anywhere.”</p>
<p class="translated">周五的报告证实了这种谨慎的乐观。虽然美国和中国显然必须继续采取行动支持他们的协议，但逮捕事件至少表明中国正在打开变革的大门。</p>
<p class="translated">真正的考验将是中国能坚持多久。就在金平离开美国几天后，<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221207024112/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/08/china-cyberspying-on-u-s-after-no-hacking-deal.html">每日野兽报道</a>中国间谍仍在入侵为美国军方工作的美国公司。从技术上讲，这些出于国家安全原因的黑客攻击不一定符合中国的商业利益，但它们突显出最近的协议是多么脆弱。</p>
<p class="translated">尽管这些逮捕和协议表明了与中国改善关系的积极步骤，但它们只是漫长道路的开始，这条道路可能会因一次违规而脱轨。</p>
