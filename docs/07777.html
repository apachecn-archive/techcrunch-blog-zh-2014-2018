				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">Bose的名字或多或少与“噪音消除”同义。至于无线？没有那么多。尽管竞争对手已经用蓝牙解决方案充斥了市场，但耳机制造商在削减电源线方面却拖拖拉拉。</p>
<p class="translated">令人欣慰的是，该公司终于准备好迈出这一大步，将无线连接引入其旗舰品牌QuietComfort。毫不奇怪，新的QuietComfort 35耳机并没有从美学上偏离该公司的标志性支柱。环绕式耳机具有多个麦克风，可主动消除噪音。</p>
<p class="translated">这些易拉罐有音乐控制和接听电话的按钮，以及可充电电池，承诺长达20小时的音乐播放，或者如Bose所说，“比从纽约到香港的航班还要长。”很公平。这款耳机从今天开始出售，售价为349.95美元。</p>

<p class="translated">两对新的耳塞也加入了新的安静舒适。更高的QuietControl 30显然被定位为该公司旗舰系列的入耳式版本。售价299.95美元(将于9月上市)，蓝牙buds还具有主动降噪麦克风(总共6个)，以及内置在脖子上的电缆中的音乐播放和呼叫控制。他们的电池充电一次应该可以使用10个小时。</p>

<p class="translated">与此同时，SoundSport耳机将与Jaybird的流行健身产品一较高下，其特点是防汗的机身和在锻炼过程中保持耳机位置的技巧。这些产品的售价为149.95美元，而内置心率监测功能的Pulse版本需要额外支付50美元。</p>
