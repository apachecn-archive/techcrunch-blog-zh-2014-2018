<p class="translated">报告还指出，iPhone 用户倾向于比 Android 用户使用略多的应用程序，但 Android 用户使用的游戏要多 30%以上。</p>
<p class="translated">起初，用户每天访问近 10 个应用的消息听起来像是几年前的一份报告中的显著增长，该报告描绘了一幅不同的应用使用情况。根据 Forrester Research 2015 年的一项研究<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329143648/https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/22/consumers-spend-85-of-time-on-smartphones-in-apps-but-only-5-apps-see-heavy-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer">，大部分用户的时间都花在了使用</a><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329143648/https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/22/consumers-spend-85-of-time-on-smartphones-in-apps-but-only-5-apps-see-heavy-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer">他们从 App Store 安装的五个非原生应用</a>上。(所谓非原生应用，是指你的手机没有附带的应用，比如电子邮件、日历、信息等。)</p>
<p class="translated">然而，Forrester 在其分析中排除了预装应用，而 App Annie 则没有。事实上，它表示，iPhone 上的实用程序和 Android 上的工具占了最大的月使用量，这在很大程度上是由于 iOS 上的 Safari 和 Android 上的 Google 等预装应用程序。</p>

<p class="translated">换句话说，当你从 App Annie 的测量中剔除预装应用时，你可能会得出与 Forrester 相同数量的应用。</p>
<p class="translated">此外，App Annie 的新数据支持了之前尼尔森的一份报告，该报告声称消费者每月可以管理的应用数量有上限。同样在 2015 年，<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329143648/https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/11/time-spent-in-apps-up-63-percent-over-past-two-years-but-apps-used-monthly-shows-little-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer">尼尔森表示，消费者每月使用 26 至 27 款应用</a>。App Annie 指出，这一趋势在很大程度上仍在继续，平均每月有 30 款应用被使用。</p>
<p class="translated">顺便说一下，这种趋势还有一个名字——30:10 规则(意思是每月大约 30 个应用，每天 10 个)。</p>

<p class="translated">App Annie 指出，过去两年花在应用上的时间也有所增加。如今，美国用户平均每天花在应用程序上的时间超过 2 小时 15 分钟，相当于一年中的一个多月。在韩国、巴西、墨西哥和日本，这个数字甚至更高，用户平均每天约 3 小时。</p>
<p class="translated">在巴西和墨西哥，一半的用户时间花在社交和通讯类应用上，而在韩国和日本，游戏占据了 25%的使用量。</p>
