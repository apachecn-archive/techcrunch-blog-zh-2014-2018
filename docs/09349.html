<p class="translated">这是这家初创公司的首轮融资，<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230405035008/https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/21/grana-which-makes-affordable-clothing-in-premium-fabrics-picks-up-1m/">之前获得了 600 万美元的种子资金</a>。这轮融资由阿里巴巴的香港基金<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230405035008/https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/19/alibaba-launches-130m-fund-to-support-entrepreneurs-in-hong-kong/">牵头，该基金于去年宣布</a>，现有投资者<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230405035008/http://goldengate.vc/">金门投资</a>(新加坡)和<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230405035008/http://www.mindworks.vc/"> MindWorks 投资</a>(香港)也参与了融资。</p>
<p class="translated">在接受 TechCrunch 采访时，联合创始人兼首席执行官卢克·格拉纳(Luke Grana)表示，新的资金将用于扩大公司的产品选择——所有产品都是自有品牌——并将其覆盖范围扩大到格拉纳目前向其发货的 12 个国家以外。特别是，Grana 专注于扩大其在美国的业务，美国已经是其除香港以外最大的市场，仅次于澳大利亚和新加坡。</p>
<p class="translated">Grana 目前没有提供具体的业务数据，只是说它的月平均增长率为 15%。退货率为个位数百分比，直接从客户处收取的费用为 10 美元、10 新加坡元或 20 港元。</p>
<p class="translated">“我们已经经历了非常强劲的增长[并且有]好的几年，我们需要继续下去，”在澳大利亚悉尼出生和长大的 Grana 说。</p>
<p class="translated">Grana 通过其网站独家销售自有品牌的时尚产品。该公司生产自己的高品质时尚产品，从意大利、秘鲁、中国和世界其他地方采购面料。迄今为止，它在香港有一家线下商店，在四个国家经营临时“弹出式”商店。Grana 刚刚在香港搬进了一个 18，000 平方英尺的新仓库，所有产品都在这里储存和运输，而其整个 50 人的团队都在香港。当客户群遍布全球时，将业务保持在一个国家可能看起来很奇怪，但格拉纳解释说，这完全是为了每个人的效率。</p>
<p class="translated">“没有分销商、中间商或仓库，所以我们直接向客户发货。他说:“我们尽可能地消除所有低效环节，这样客户就能以前所未有的质量获得真正伟大的产品。”。</p>
<p class="translated">谈到业务，Grana 解释说，香港作为世界上最大的航空货运中心的地位，以及 DHL 的运费，意味着它对美国和其他国家的次日/两天交付服务与任何当地服务一样。这是基于客户的速度和 Grana 的价格。出于这个原因，Grana 没有在美国或其他地方开设仓库来储存产品。</p>
<p class="translated">就将成本转嫁给消费者而言，格拉纳表示，由于加工链的原因，大多数时尚产品的价格都是成本的七到八倍。但他说，除去上述中间商和费用，Grana 的售价只有 2-3 倍的溢价。</p>
<p class="translated">“我们走遍世界，寻找制作现代衣柜必需品的最佳面料:适合大型市场穿着的优质产品，”格拉纳补充道。“我们希望复制 ASOS，但使用我们自己的品牌。”</p>

<p class="translated">没有通过线下零售商推出产品的计划，Grana 也不会成为其他志同道合的独立时尚品牌的销售平台。我们的目标是继续保持现状，但扩大其覆盖范围。</p>
<p class="translated">全球扩张是 2017 年的议程，但首席执行官卢克·格拉纳没有具体说明具体将针对哪些国家。中国是名单上的一个确定的名字，可能会在“明年的某个时候”进行试运行为此，Grana 可能会稍微改变其分销模式，并与现有的电子商务门户网站结盟，以扩大覆盖范围。格拉纳暗示，阿里巴巴的淘宝市场可能是一个理想的切入点，他说他的公司正在与电子商务巨头密切合作，以衡量其进入中国的方法。</p>
<p class="translated">“与阿里巴巴非常契合，从战略上讲，我们非常依赖中国的电子商务，并获得物流和基础设施支持，”他说。</p>
<p class="translated">在产品方面，Grana 的产品系列涵盖 10 种面料、90 种风格和 3，000 种单品，涵盖短裤、毛衣、泳装和男女时装内衣。格拉纳说，该公司计划明年初扩展到运动装、包和配饰，同时他也希望从更长远的角度开始生产和销售鞋子等产品。</p>
