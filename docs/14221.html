<p class="translated">福特 Fusion 混合动力自动驾驶汽车将用于测试，配备由达美乐的合作伙伴 Roush Enterprises 制造的披萨容器，旨在途中保持披萨的温度，并在客户输入其独特的交付代码时解锁。这些车辆将提供给随机选择的在密歇根州安阿伯订购披萨的达美乐客户，当他们被选中时，客户端可以选择通过 AV 接收送货。</p>
<p class="translated">福特和达美乐都将利用这项测试来观察人们对通过无人驾驶汽车接收披萨的反应。福特认为自动驾驶技术的客户和用户体验方面是其开发的整体平台的核心部分，福特自动驾驶和电动汽车副总裁 Sherif Marakby 告诉我，它正在利用这一现实世界的试验来测试其假设，并帮助它开发产品的这一方面，希望在短短几年内实现商业化。</p>

<p class="translated">“独特的是，我们在开发反病毒技术的同时也在进行人种学研究，”马拉克比说。“我们这样做的原因是，我们将学习我们不知道的东西，我们希望有机会从时间的角度将这些变化纳入汽车，或汽车界面和消费者互动。”</p>
<p class="translated">福特不一定习惯于这种情况——多年来，它从核心技术的角度做了很多改进汽车的工作，但它对自己的消费者类别有几十年的经验，在某种程度上知道他们在每一代人中想要什么。有了 AVs，就有更多悬而未决的事情了。</p>
<p class="translated">“通常，在汽车行业，你了解客户，你为消费者计划某些事情，”马拉克比解释说。“在这种情况下，我们仍在试图理解，我们正在与理解消费者的合作伙伴合作，并在开发技术的同时，找出我们需要对汽车做什么。”</p>

<p class="translated">达美乐和福特过去曾在许多项目上合作过，包括通过福特的车载同步软件和应用平台建立一种订购披萨的方法。他们之前的关系导致了关于 AVs 在食品配送中的潜在价值的讨论。</p>
<p class="translated">“两家公司几个月前决定合作，”马拉克比告诉我。“福特正在开发自动驾驶汽车技术，而达美乐实际上非常专注于如何改善送货业务的技术方面。我认为，人们普遍认为，自动驾驶汽车可以让很多东西交付，这将使整个交付过程更容易、更简单，甚至可能更友好。”</p>
<p class="translated">正如马拉克比所描述的，这就是这些公司后来决定建立他们现在开始的“人种学研究”项目的原因。它的目标是弄清楚在走向市场的策略中需要什么，以满足消费者的需求和像这样的自主服务的需求。</p>

<p class="translated">Marakby 重申，他们战略的关键是福特不会等待自动驾驶组件做好上路准备，这是由设计决定的:汽车制造商认为，在与 AVs 接口时，对消费者想要的用户体验的坚定理解与能够在真实道路上导航同样重要。</p>
<p class="translated">Marakby 说，福特的目标仍然是在 2021 年的时间框架内，大规模地建立能够及时服务于这样一个行业的自动驾驶车队，因此弄清楚人们想要什么样的送货或运输 AV，并在车辆设计等细节仍在最终确定的时候现在就这样做是很重要的。</p>
<p class="translated">此次试验中使用的自动驾驶汽车仍将有人驾驶——安全驾驶员将在场，以确保一切顺利，并进行观察，并在必要时接管。但这里真正的考验不是针对司机，甚至不是所使用的自动驾驶汽车的自动驾驶方面——这一切都与最终用户有关，以及他们如何看待从其他人那里交付热气腾腾的披萨饼。</p>
