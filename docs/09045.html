<p class="translated">即使是在最完善的仓库空间导航也会变得棘手，而记录丢失的库存则是彻头彻尾的噩梦，需要全体员工在几天的时间里清点和重新清点托盘，以期确定是否有任何东西丢失。让我们坦诚一分钟:人类不擅长数数。另一方面，机器人，嗯，那是它们被设计来做的。</p>
<p class="translated">Marc Gyongyosi 解释说:“库存损失每年给公司造成数十亿美元的损失。这位<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230317063507/http://ifm-tech.com/"> IFM </a>(智能飞行机器)的首席执行官创建了他的公司，希望将在宝马公司从事人机界面工作的经验教训应用于代价高昂的仓库库存枯竭问题。</p>
<p class="translated">“根据我在工业机器人方面的背景，我经常看到他们目前在仓库中的系统，东西总是会丢失，”他继续说道。“你不会相信东西经常丢失。当他们去寻找东西时，他们不得不爬上叉车和梯子。他们甚至会带双筒望远镜来找东西。”</p>

<p class="translated">IFM 对代价高昂的库存枯竭问题的解决方案是一小群无人机，这些高精度计数机器人带有机载系统，允许它们在没有直接人工监督的情况下浏览仓库内部。IFM 的无人机被设计成在仓库轮班之间部署，自主起飞，扫描过道，降落充电。</p>
<p class="translated">这个过程取决于仓库的大小和部署的无人机数量，但平均来说，应该需要 20 分钟左右。通过扫描收集的信息被上传，并与公司的库存软件相互参照。错误被记录下来，警报被发送到贴在过道尽头的平板电脑上，工人们在轮班开始时检查平板电脑，看看是否有东西丢失了。</p>

<p class="translated">IFM 已经与不同的公司开始了一个试点项目，包括一些未透露姓名的汽车制造商，并计划明年推出其首次商业推广。Gyongyosi 补充说，该系统可能有超出其初始库存解决方案的影响。“我们有户外用的谷歌地图，”这位高管解释道。“但我们在室内没有这样的东西。所有的制造都在室内进行。有很多数据需要在室内收集，这项技术是创建一个可以自主收集这些信息的系统的第一步。”</p>
