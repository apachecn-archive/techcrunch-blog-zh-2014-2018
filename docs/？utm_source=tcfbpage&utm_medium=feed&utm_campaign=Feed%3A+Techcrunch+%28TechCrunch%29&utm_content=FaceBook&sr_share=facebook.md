[Following the passage of a new cybersecurity law](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know/) and [the removal of term limits from Chinese president Xi Jinping](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/11/592694991/china-removes-presidential-term-limits-enabling-xi-jinping-to-rule-indefinitely), China’s government is conducting a comprehensive crackdown on online discussions and content, with few companies spared the rod by the central government.

Among the casualties has been Bytedance, the extremely high-flying $20 billion media unicorn startup [that was forced to publicly apologize](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2141312/chinas-king-titillating-content-issues-apology-providing-what-people) for content that degraded the character of the nation. The government forced the company to shut down its popular Neihan Duanzi comedy app, as well as to remove its headline news app, Jinri Toutiao, for three weeks. The company announced that it would expand the number of human censors from 6,000 to 10,000.

[Another high-flying media unicorn](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/tencent-back-chinese-instagram-kuaishou/), Kuaishou, has been [under fire for allowing teenage moms to be depicted in a positive light](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1002036/kuaishou-deletes-teen-mom-content-following-media-pressure). The app is unique among China’s top social networks in [focusing on ordinary Chinese](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://technode.com/2017/05/17/kwai-kuaishou-chinas-biggest-social-video-sharing-app/), and is known for its focus on people outside of large cities like Beijing and Shanghai. The company has faced public criticism from central television channel CCTV, as well as from regulators who have demanded the company act more aggressively in removing the content, [a demand to which the company has acquiesced](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2139874/chinese-live-streaming-app-kuaishou-cracks-down-teenage-mom-videos).

Meanwhile, over at Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like service, the company announced on Friday that it [would ban violent and gay content from its service](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/http://news.trust.org/item/20180414030143-8oda9/), following instructions from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television. LGBT content has been in the crosshairs of the country’s media regulators for years; for example, censors banned “[abnormal sexual behaviors](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/http://fortune.com/2017/06/30/china-homosexuality-internet-weibo-censorship/)” from being depicted in any media or mobile apps in 2017, a term which includes homosexuality.

However, in a rare about-face for corporate China and internet censors, the company announced that [it would reverse its ban of LGBT-themed content](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43779650), [following thousands of comments](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/world/asia/china-gay-ban-sina-weibo-.html) and discussions online by gay Chinese citizens. The company’s crackdown on other content, though, is expected to continue.

There are other forms of censorship underway these days in China. China’s soccer players recently [were banned from having tattoos](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustrick/2018/03/27/china-just-banned-tattoos-on-its-soccer-players-and-it-could-cost-them/#10708f0b7db2), as it depicts a “dispirited culture,” which is banned on all media. Perhaps most importantly, [the government has banned the use of private VPNs](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/china-s-internet-underground-fights-for-its-life), in order to better control online discourse.

China’s censorship regime is certainly not new, but its intensity around culture and how it is depicted is relatively novel. While the Chinese government has generally kept a tight lid on political dissent, particularly since the Tiananmen Protests in 1989, it has generally used a lighter touch on non-political subjects.

However, the Communist Party of China is now attempting to control the culture much more directly, not just on broadcast media like television, but also on apps and devices throughout the Middle Kingdom.

Following the National People’s Congress in March, the regulation of China’s media has been [reassigned from the government to the party’s Central Propaganda Department](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/china-propaganda-03212018140841.html). Since then, the party has been working in overdrive to tamp down content that it deems to be foreign, crude, vulgar or not in the best spirit of the Chinese people.

虽然中国的媒体创业公司通常主要集中在中国大陆，但它们的应用程序也位于其他国家的应用程序商店中。被迫关闭其新闻应用的 Bytedance 还拥有 [musical.ly](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/http://musical.ly/) ，根据一些估计，大约 14%的美国青少年使用的[流行音乐视频应用。那时，中国的审查制度并不止于国界，而是可以将其影响扩展到更广的范围。](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Teen-Favorite-Lip-Synch-App-Musically-Finds-New-Owner/1016741)

另一个例子是流行的同性恋交友应用[Grindr，它在 2016 年初将大部分股权出售给了北京昆仑科技公司](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007223117/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/technology/grindr-sells-stake-to-chinese-company.html)。

随着新规定在全国统一实施，对言论的打击预计将在未来几周继续。这种情况提醒人们，在这个受到严格控制的国家经营的中国企业面临着种种挑战。

虽然目前美中之间存在许多贸易紧张，但一个关键问题是美国科技公司进入中国市场。不过，即使中国开放边境，美国公司如何在保持自身道德标准的同时忠实执行中国法律，仍不明朗。
