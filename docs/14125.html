<p class="translated">360照片在脸书上表现为普通图片，这意味着你可以将它们发布到你的时间线，与其他标准图像一起在相册中共享它们，并将它们添加到组中。使用脸书相机拍摄也被设计得尽可能简单，脸书采用计算机视觉在你旋转手机拍摄全景照片后自动拼接照片。</p>
<p class="translated">【YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhQVOhsOqM&amp;w=680&amp;h=383]</p>
<p class="translated">如果你想试试的话，根据这方面的专家脸书自己的说法，以下是在脸书拍摄360°照片的方法:</p>
<ul>
<li class="translated"><blockquote> <p>打开脸书应用程序，点击你的新闻顶部的“360度照片”选项，在那里你可以更新你的状态</p> </blockquote></li>
<li class="translated"><blockquote> <p>按下蓝色按钮，沿着路径从开始到结束，直到你拍摄了一幅完整的全景图</p> </blockquote></li>
<li class="translated"><blockquote> <p>在照片中选择您喜欢的“起始视图”并分享</p> </blockquote></li>
</ul>
