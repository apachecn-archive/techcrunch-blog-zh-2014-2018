<p class="translated">今天在TechCrunch CES硬件战场舞台上竞争的ShapeScale ，旨在建立一种更直观的方式来跟踪你的健身情况。该公司的产品是一种联网的智能秤，可以对用户的身体进行3D扫描，并跟踪体重的增减和肌肉的清晰度。配套的应用程序可以帮助你可视化一段时间内的进展，并创建你身体上已经成功或需要健身部门帮助的区域的热图。</p>
<p class="translated">从这里开始，该应用程序深入研究目标设置，让你看到如何瞄准你身体的特定区域将改善你的整体体质。比方说，如果你想增加5%的二头肌，同时减掉10%的腹部，那么ShapeScale应用程序可以帮助你确定你目前的饮食和锻炼计划是否取得了进展。</p>
