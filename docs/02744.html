<p class="translated">去年11月，微软首次推出了适用于Android平板电脑的Office预览版。在很大程度上，Office for Android看起来就像微软大约一年前推出的iPad版本。正如微软Office部门总经理朱莉娅·怀特(Julia White)本周早些时候告诉我的那样，iOS和Android版本来自相同的代码库，因此在功能上实际上也没有什么区别。</p>

<p class="translated">微软现在已经统一了其跨平台的Office应用程序的外观，事实证明，Android和iPad的Office几乎预示了<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230402135945/https://blogs.office.com/2015/01/22/next-chapter-office-windows/"> Office 2016 </a>的外观和感觉。你可以看看我们的【iPad版Office评测，更好地了解这些应用的功能。</p>
<p class="translated">就像在iPad上一样，Android平板电脑的应用程序是免费的，你可以用它们来创建和编辑文件(如果你还在做的话，还可以打印它们)。</p>
<p class="translated">微软告诉我，在安卓应用测试期间，它看到了大约250，000次下载。由于这个庞大的测试团队，微软能够从大约500种不同的设备型号中收集性能和崩溃数据。</p>
<p class="translated">以下是应用程序的系统要求:设备需要7英寸或更大的屏幕，并需要运行KitKat 4.4。这很简单。然而，奇怪的是，这些应用程序也可以在Android 5.0 Lollipop上运行，但没有得到官方支持。下一个更新将会改变这一点。很可能，这是因为微软还没有能够从棒棒糖用户那里获得足够的反馈——因为还没有那么多设备运行最新版本的谷歌移动操作系统。</p>
<p class="translated">iOS版Office对微软来说是一个巨大的成功。该公司今天还宣布，这些应用程序现已被下载超过8000万次。</p>
