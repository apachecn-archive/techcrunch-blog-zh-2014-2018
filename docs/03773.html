<p class="translated">除了引入新的媒体类型，如播客和视频，该服务还将提供更加个性化的播放列表，并与你当时正在做的事情相关。</p>
<p class="translated">“音乐正在脱离流派，”丹尼尔·埃克在舞台上说。“人们不再搜索嘻哈或乡村音乐，而是搜索活动或特定的体验。”</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>关联性</strong></p>
<p class="translated">与专注于流派相反，这项服务将更像Songza，并考虑到你过去听过的音乐，关于你是谁的信息(如年龄和位置)以及一天中的时间。Spotify更密切地关注你在一天中历史上听过的内容，并整理出适合该特定时间的播放列表。</p>

<p class="translated">例如，在早上，用户可能会看到类似“快乐起床”或“日出跑步”的播放列表，或者可能是用户已经创建并在这段时间经常收听的播放列表。</p>
<p class="translated">用户可以从一个播放列表滑动到下一个，这些播放列表将自动播放，让用户感受里面的内容。</p>
<p class="translated">Spotify能够做到这一点，是因为它拥有大量数据(自推出以来已有250亿小时的收听时间)，可以利用这些数据来了解人们如何一起播放音乐，何时收听不同的音乐，以及他们与其他用户的相似程度。</p>
<p class="translated">但这超出了相关性。</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>内容</strong></p>
<p class="translated">Spotify还在增加新类型的媒体内容，如视频、新闻和播客。在过去的几个月里，我们听说了Spotify增加播客和视频内容的计划，今天它似乎要开花结果了。</p>
<p class="translated">一些媒体合作伙伴包括NBC，Slate，Vice NEWS，BBC，NBC，ABC，Conde Nast brands (GQ，Vogue，Wired)，Comedy Central MTV，E！、TeamCoco、成人游泳、精英日报、TED、CBS电台、PRX等等。</p>
<p class="translated">从公告来看，似乎大部分视频内容将作为热门节目和节目的剪辑。例如，喜剧中心将提供他们超受欢迎的节目《宽阔的城市》的片段。</p>

<p class="translated"><strong>运行中</strong></p>
<p class="translated">新的Spotify还有一个全新的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230404204351/https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/spotify-for-runners/">“跑步”功能</a>，可以接入你手机的许多传感器(加速度计、陀螺仪等)。)来计算你跑步的速度，并为你提供一个播放列表，每首歌曲都有完美的BPM。另外，播放列表仍然是围绕你的既定口味。</p>
<p class="translated">但是，Spotify不仅对音乐进行了计时，使其与你的脚在地面上的节拍相匹配，还创造了一种新的音乐格式，其中作曲实际上根据你的节奏进行改变和重新排列。该功能将推出六种不同的体验。跑步体验将于今年夏天晚些时候通过Nike应用程序和RunKeeper应用程序提供。</p>
<p class="translated">新的Spotify将于今天在美国、英国、德国和瑞典推出。</p>
<p class="translated">总的来说，从手动选择流派到自动个性化播放列表的转变应该会让Spotify对休闲音乐迷来说更容易。与此同时，增加播客可以吸引核心新闻和电台粉丝。两者都可以帮助Spotify吸引更多用户尝试其免费广告支持层，然后将他们转化为付费用户。艺术家和唱片公司可能会反感免费层，Spotify会增加更多内容类型，但这是这项服务告诉人们值得付费的方式。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，视频感觉像是一种延伸。Spotify的大部分收听都是被动的。在手机上，人们在旅途中或锻炼时尽情摇滚，而在台式机上，他们在网上冲浪时在后台播放音乐。视频是一种你盯着屏幕的主动体验。那是非常不同的行为。</p>
<p class="translated">开发视频服务可能会在关键时刻分散Spotify的注意力，因为它将不得不在今年夏天抵御苹果新的流媒体音乐服务。当然，它可以让Spotify获得利润丰厚的视频浏览量。但这家瑞典初创公司最好是加强其核心产品，而不是在更多领域挑起争斗。</p>
