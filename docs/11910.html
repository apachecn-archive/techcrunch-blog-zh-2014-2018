<p class="translated">脸书向其更广泛的用户群推出类似工具只是时间问题，特别是考虑到这类在线活动和围绕它们的社交活动持续流行。</p>
<p class="translated">然而，个人筹资者在启动时仅限于六个关键类别:教育(学费、书籍或教室用品)；医疗(程序、治疗、伤害)；宠物医疗；危机救济(公共危机或自然灾害)；个人紧急事件(房屋火灾、盗窃、车祸)；以及丧葬费和损失费(丧葬费，生活费)。</p>
<p class="translated">脸书表示，随着更多审查过程的自动化，它希望随着时间的推移扩大类别列表。脸书说，它目前有一个24小时的主动审查过程，以确保筹款人符合类别和社区政策。</p>

<p class="translated">个人筹款活动也只对美国18岁以上的人开放，它将首先进行测试。</p>
<p class="translated">脸书说，他们还将收取6.9%+$ 0.30的费用，用于“支付处理费、资金筹集审查、安全和欺诈保护”。(然而，在脸书，非营利组织支付不同的费用结构。相比之下，GoFundMe收取7.9%+. 30美元用于个人或慈善活动。</p>
<p class="translated">与它的其他筹款产品类似，访问个人活动的用户可以点击按钮邀请朋友，分享活动或点击蓝色大按钮捐款，同时留在网站上。这也鼓励了脸书更多的支付交易——尽管Messenger中增加了点对点支付，但这一业务领域目前仍不发达。</p>

</p>
<p class="translated">除了个人筹款，脸书网页现在可以在他们的视频直播中加入“捐赠”按钮。这也将允许公众人物、品牌、企业和非盈利组织以外的其他组织筹集资金。</p>
<p class="translated">脸书说，观看视频直播的人可以选择边看边捐，也可以在视频结束并上传到网页后捐。</p>
<p class="translated"><em>美国东部时间下午12点更新，包括关于审核流程的更多信息；下午3点东部时间与个人和非营利组织的收费结构。</em></p>
