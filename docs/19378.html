<p class="translated">此外，该公司预测，2018年假期后，近一半(48%)的美国消费者将拥有智能扬声器。</p>
<p class="translated">报告称，假期期间，目前拥有智能音箱的消费者中，45%的人说他们计划为自己再买一个，23%的人计划为别人买一个。与此同时，23%的非车主表示，他们计划为自己买一辆，9%的人计划为别人买一辆。</p>

<p class="translated">然而，尽管智能家居控制是这些新型设备的一个关键功能，但只有31%的设备所有者使用语音命令来控制智能家居。</p>
<p class="translated">这项研究也在一定程度上反驳了信息公司的一份早期报告，该报告称，只有2%的Alexa用户使用语音进行了购买。尽管Adobe的研究着眼于美国的整体智能扬声器市场，而不仅仅是Alexa设备，但它没有发现同样的趋势。相反，它发现30%的智能音箱用户使用这些设备“购物或订购物品”</p>
<p class="translated">虽然不是最热门的语音活动之一，但它是Adobe视为“新兴用例”的活动，其他活动包括送餐、发送信息、玩游戏、智能家居命令、旅行研究和理财。</p>
<p class="translated">但Adobe澄清了其关于语音购物的调查结果，称大多数人不是直接通过智能扬声器购买，而是在购物过程的早期阶段使用它们。也就是说，近一半的消费者(47%)报告称他们使用手机进行产品研究或搜索，43%的消费者使用手机创建购物清单，32%的消费者使用手机进行价格比较。</p>
<p class="translated">尽管如此，它报告称，四分之一的智能音箱用户至少下过一次性订单，21%的用户会再次订购经常购买的产品。</p>

<p class="translated">告诉Alexa在列表中添加一些东西是一个相当常见的用例，尽管在信息之前获得的数字中，这可能不被算作“购买”。尽管如此，智能扬声器在购物过程的一开始就参与进来是有道理的——可以说是提醒购买一些东西——考虑到“警报和提醒”的使用是最热门的活动之一，Adobe表示，使用率为46%。</p>
